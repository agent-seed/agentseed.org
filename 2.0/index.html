                <p>Due to the very unfortunate removal of the landmark Roe vs. Wade supreme court case.  We will be boycotting July 4th, by completely avoiding participation in the American tradition of Independence day.

                <h2> Minecraft Java moderation</h2>
                <p>I'm sure everyone here had heard about Microsoft's attempts to moderate Minecraft: Java Edition, I'm also sure most of you know that most of the     playerbase is very resistive of this change. The new changes in release 1.19.1 will allow player reporting on any server, and banning from any server.
                    To protect this community and myself I am going to use a plugin to prevent reporting when this feature does release. This plugin works by not verifying the identity of the player any message was sent by, therefor making it possible to impersonate someone, because of this Microsoft will not let you report the message.
                    If do not like this, and would rather have a reporting enabled, I suggest you go play on a different server. This is not because I am striving for a toxic server environment, but because I fear this give to trolls and trouble makers.
                    I urge you all to stand out against Microsoft for allowing this.
                <p>

                    TL;DR:
                    Microsoft is doing things I don't like, and I'm installing mods to prevent this

                <h2>Javascript and this website</h2>
                <p>This website uses no Javascript. I don't like the way Javascript is used on the modern web, sure there's very interesting things that people use it for, but it's also used for tracking which I <i>don't</i> like. To inspire trust and to make my site easier on slow computers I decided to find other ways to accomplish the things I had used javascript for on previous revisions of this site.</p>
